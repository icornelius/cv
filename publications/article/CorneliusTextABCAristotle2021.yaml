    The Middle English ABC of Aristotle is an alliterative abecedary poem that
    survives in fifteen manuscript copies dating between the mid-fifteenth and
    early sixteenth centuries. The most eccentric copy, bearing the greatest
    number of unique textual variants, is in London, British Library, Additional
    60577, a commonplace book and miscellany of verse and prose known today as
    the ‘Winchester Anthology’. The Winchester copy of the ABC of Aristotle is
    distinguished from all others by changes to vocabulary, idiom, and prosody.
    The result is a unique redaction, illustrating the kind of literary
    composition that could be expected to grow out of late medieval English
    grammar schools. The Winchester redaction also expresses a shift in prosodic
    allegiance. The traditional alliterative line is subtly reshaped into an
    accentual-syllabic form.

    An essay in the history of knowledge, tracing the nineteenth-century
    emergence and consolidation of the thesis that Old English poetry was
    accentual. Argues that this paradigm misrepresents central features of the
    Old English meter and of the Middle English form that developed from it. See
    now the version in Reconstructing Alliterative Verse.

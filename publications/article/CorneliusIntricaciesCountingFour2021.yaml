    The metrical theory devised by Eduard Sievers and refined by A. J. Bliss
    forms the basis for most current scholarship on Old English meter. A
    weakness of the Sievers–Bliss theory is that it occupies a middle ground
    between two levels of analytic description, distinguished by Roman Jakobson
    in an influential article as ‘verse instance’ and ‘verse design’. Metrists
    in the Sievers–Bliss tradition employ a concept of metrical position (a key
    component of verse design), yet the focus of attention usually remains on
    the contours of stress of individual verses. Important exceptions are the
    studies of Thomas Cable and Nicolay Yakovlev. The theoretical innovations of
    Cable and Yakovlev, among others, enable a more concise presentation of
    verse design than anyone writing on the subject has yet offered. The present
    essay attempts to show what such a presentation might look like, while also
    giving due acknowledgment to the complexities of position-count in this
    meter. We presume no prior knowledge of the Sieversian system. Illustrations
    are drawn principally from Cædmon’s Hymn and the Seafarer.

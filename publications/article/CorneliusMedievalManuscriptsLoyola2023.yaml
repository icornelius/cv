    This article provides a summary overview of the collection of pre-1600
    western European manuscripts in Loyola University Chicago Archives and
    Special Collections. The collection presently comprises four manuscript
    codices, at least 38 fragments, and four documents. The codices are a
    thirteenth-century Book of Hours from German-speaking lands; a
    fifteenth-century Dutch prayerbook; a preacher’s compilation written
    probably in southern Germany in the 1440s; and two fifteenth-century Italian
    humanist booklets, bound together since the nineteenth century, transmitting
    Donatus’s commentary on the *Eunuchus* (incomplete) and an anthology of
    theological excerpts, respectively. The fragments consist of thirteen leaves
    from books dismembered by modern booksellers (most are from
    fifteenth-century Books of Hours) and a larger number of binding fragments,
    all but two of which remain *in situ*. These represent the remains of ten
    manuscript books: four Latin liturgical books, two texts of Roman civil law,
    one large-format thirteenth-century Italian Bible, one thirteenth-century
    copy of Ptolemy’s *Almagest* in the translation of Gerard of Cremona, one
    late fourteenth-century copy of the Ockhamist *Tractatus de principiis
    theologiae*, and one fifteenth-century Dutch Book of Hours in the
    translation of Geert Grote. Many of these materials have remained
    unidentified until now.

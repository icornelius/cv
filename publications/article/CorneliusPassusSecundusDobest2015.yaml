    John Burrow has argued that a program of rubrics recorded in many
    manuscripts of Piers Plowman is organic to this poem in its B version. In
    this article I demonstrate that a manuscript rubric known to Burrow but
    omitted from his stemmatic reconstruction supplies further support for it:
    the rubrication scheme reconstructable on the basis of attestations in one
    of the two manuscript families explains the existence of a lone anomalous
    rubric in a manuscript of the second main family. The implication is that
    the full rubrication scheme was present in the common ancestor of both
    families. This is a small point, but it has important implications for our
    understanding of the internal organization, textual transmission, and
    versional development of Langland’s poem.


    The anomalous rubric at the center of my argument figures prominently in
    Lawrence Warner’s 2011 book Lost History of ‘Piers Plowman’; there it is
    offered as firm evidence that the B archetype was contaminated from a C
    version manuscript. The account I offer is incompatible with Warner’s and is
    intended to replace it. I conclude by elaborating the implications of this
    position. The final two passus of the poem (B XIX-XX) are integral to the
    currents of biblical and ecclesiastical history begun in passus XVI; this
    great narrative arc reaches its apogee not in the vision of Christ’s
    Crucifixion and the Harrowing of Hell (both passus XVIII), but about three
    hundred lines into passus XIX, when the primitive Church begins to spread
    the faith “as wyde as þe worlde is.” The archetypal rubrics identify the
    final passus of the poem as the only full passus de dobest, and this is as
    it should be: it is part of the Langland’s tragic vision of history that
    there is no passus secundus de dobest.

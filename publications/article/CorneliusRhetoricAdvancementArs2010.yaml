    This article examines the medieval *ars dictaminis*, or art of letter-writing,
    focusing on socio-cultural aspects, especially as taught at Oxford c.
    1370–1432. *Ars dictaminis* participated in and contributed to a structural
    transformation in the production of written communications and
    administrative records in later medieval Europe. Two aspects of this
    transformation were the recruitment and educational formation of a class of
    domestic literate servants, and a diversification in the field of
    educational alternatives. Teachers of *ars dictaminis* recognized and
    responded to these aspects of their pragmatic situation: in addition to
    providing technical instruction, the *ars dictaminis* provided its students
    and practitioners with normative representations of their location within a
    stratified social world. In several textbooks of English provenance,
    instruction in cursus, or prose rhythm, became an occasion for working out
    this discipline’s contested status within the symbolic economies of
    education and patronage.

    Scholarship on the meter of fourteenth-century English alliterative verse
    demonstrates that lines end with a trochaic constituent. *Piers Plowman* is
    a recognized anomaly, yet there is disagreement about the extent of the
    differences. Focusing on the B version of the poem, this essay examines line
    endings with an irregular word division, syllable count, or vocalic quality.
    Particular attention is given to lines ending in personal pronouns, *-ly*
    adverbs, compounds in *-man*, compounds in *-nesse*, nouns in *-(i)oun*, and
    gerunds. Prosodic constraints are identified by comparing the incidence of
    each sequence at the close of the a-verse and b-verse. Many individual items
    skew towards the norms of usage observed in other alliterative poems, yet,
    more than other alliterative poets, Langland allows semantic and expository
    priorities to override prosodic form.

  abstract: >-
    The Lay Folks’ Catechism is an English rendering of injunctions issued in
    1357 by John Thoresby, Archbishop of York, setting forth the elements of
    Christian belief. Ever since W. W. Skeat’s treatments, the Catechism has
    been placed in the general orbit of alliterative verse, yet closer
    identifications have proved elusive. The text is now recorded in both The
    Index of Middle English Verse and The Index of Middle English Prose; the
    principal stylistic study proposes that John Gaytryge, the author of the
    English text, may have been influenced by the system of Latin prose rhythm
    known as cursus. Renewed treatment must begin by establishing an accurate
    and authoritative text. Collation of the two best copies, York, Borthwick
    Institute, MS Abp Reg 11 and Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Don.c.13, confirms
    the general authority of the York copy. Recent studies of alliterative metre
    allow Gaytryge’s composition to be distinguished with confidence from that
    English verse form. Affiliations to Latin cursus are more difficult to
    assess, but doubtful: more likely influences are the Latin of the Creed,
    Pater noster, and other pastoralia, and the plain style that preachers were
    instructed to adopt in preaching to the laity. The form of the Catechism may
    have been a deliberate innovation: a new plain style in the vernacular,
    aiming to embody the priorities of pastoral instruction.

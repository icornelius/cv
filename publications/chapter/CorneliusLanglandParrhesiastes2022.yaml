  abstract: >-
    The ancient Greek word parrhēsia designates speech that is bold, frank, and
    free, holding nothing back; a parrhēsiastēs is a person who gives voice to
    such speech. Although the word was little used in Latin literature and had
    no precise Latin equivalent, the concept was transmitted to medieval western
    Europe in rhetorical theory and the New Testament. In this essay I propose
    that the concept of parrhēsia may help to register the irruptive force,
    pointedness, risks, and complexity of certain acts of saying in Piers
    Plowman, a fourteenth-century English vision poem. For most of this essay, I
    focus on a single discursive feature of Piers Plowman: moral admonishment
    addressed in the second person to audiences outside the represented world of
    the poem. I argue that monitory address is an important and well-defined
    feature of Piers Plowman, that the poet’s confidence in his monitory voice
    grows during his composition of the poem, and that this feature of the poem
    culminates in Conscience’s parrhesiastic addresses to bishops and the King
    in the C Version Prologue. As a coda to this argument, I propose a reading
    of the dreamer as a figure of wisdom-seeking parrhēsia.

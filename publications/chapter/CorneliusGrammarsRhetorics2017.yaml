    Grammar and rhetoric were the disciplines charged with teaching correct and
    effective use of language in antiquity. In the Middle Ages, these
    disciplines served to maintain Latin as a language of culture, religion, and
    administration over much of Europe. Grammatical studies flourished in
    medieval England following the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons to
    Christianity. Subsequent developments in grammatical and rhetorical studies
    in Britain in the Middle Ages track deep changes in the social conditioning
    of literacy and social demands upon literacy. Among the medieval British
    innovations in these disciplines were the teaching of Latin as a foreign
    language, the cultural accommodation of grammar and rhetoric to
    Christianity, the creation of new genres of rhetorical textbooks, and the
    development of bilingual pedagogies that paired Latin with vernacular
    languages.

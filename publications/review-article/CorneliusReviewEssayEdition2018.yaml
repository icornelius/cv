    The B-Version Archetype, published on-line and in print by the Piers Plowman
    Electronic Archive (PPEA), deserves close study by all scholars of
    Langland’s poem. John Burrow, Thorlac Turville-Petre, and their PPEA
    collaborators have produced an ‘intermittently critical edition’ and the
    best record now available of the received text of Piers Plowman B. Where it
    differs from previous critical editions, Burrow and Turville-Petre’s text
    serves as a valuable check on editorial judgement. An appendix to this
    review essay employs The B Version Archetype in a demonstration study of
    Langland’s metrical grammar.

    Paul Eggert’s The Work and the Reader in Literary Studies: Scholarly Editing
    and Book History elaborates a general program for the study of literature
    centered on the question, “What is the thing read?” Concepts of document,
    text, and work are parsed with care, generating many valuable insights and
    clarifications, but there is need for more thinking about the linguistic
    medium of literature. To textual studies, bibliography, and book history —
    the trio of foundational disciplines advocated by Eggert — one should add
    philology, or the study of literary language.
